# Stock Exchange Stimulator
**Repository includes a C++ implementation of a high-speed trading matching engine meeting specified requirements.**

**Clear documentation, efficient code, and thorough testing ensure reliability.**

**Utilizes TCP/IP for order communication.**

## Objective:

Implement a stock exchange matching engine for high-speed trading.

**Features to Implement:**

1. Accept buy and sell orders.
2. Orders include: ID, Type (Buy/Sell), Price, Quantity.
3. Match orders efficiently based on price and time.
4. Support partial fills.

## Communication Logic:

Use TCP/IP (windows socket function)for user order input and trade output.
## Efficiency:

Optimize for speed to handle a large volume of orders. (can be accept trade without any hustle)
## Source Code Include:

1. Source code for the matching engine.
2. User manual with compile/run instructions for installation and startup (TCP/IP specifications and configuration).
3. Test plan with varied scenarios and sample data.
4. Data generator program for high-speed order data via TCP/IP.
5. Correctness in order matching and partial fills.
6. Efficiency in handling a high volume of orders.
7. Proper TCP/IP connection for orders and trades.
8. Well-structured, documented, and readable code.
9. Comprehensive testing plan with diverse scenarios.
