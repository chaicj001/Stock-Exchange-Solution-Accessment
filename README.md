# Stock Exchange Stimulator
##Repository includes a C++ implementation of a high-speed trading matching engine meeting specified requirements.
##Clear documentation, efficient code, and thorough testing ensure reliability.
##Utilizes TCP/IP for order communication.

Objective:

Implement a stock exchange matching engine for high-speed trading.

Features to Implement:

1. Accept buy and sell orders.
2. Orders include: ID, Type (Buy/Sell), Price, Quantity.
3. Match orders efficiently based on price and time.
4. Support partial fills.

Communication Logic:

Use TCP/IP (windows socket function)for user order input and trade output.
Efficiency:

Optimize for speed to handle a large volume of orders. (can be accept trade without any hustle)
Deliverables:

Source code for the matching engine.
User manual with compile/run instructions and TCP/IP specifications.
Test plan with varied scenarios and sample data.
Data generator program for high-speed order data via TCP/IP.

Correctness in order matching and partial fills.
Efficiency in handling a high volume of orders.
Proper TCP/IP connection for orders and trades.
Well-structured, documented, and readable code.
Comprehensive testing plan with diverse scenarios.
